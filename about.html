  <h1><center>About Genshin Impact</center></h1>
  <h2><center>What is Genshin Impact?</center></h2>
  <p>Genshin Impact is an action role-playing game created by Chinese developer HoYoverse (previously MiHoYo). It features an open-world concept with an anime-style design, and players take part in an action-based battle system by switching characters and using skills that correspond to the elements of the world. This game is available to play on various devices such as PC, mobile, PS4 etc. I personally play on mobile more often these days since it's more convenient, but I really enjoy the PC controls as well!</p>
  <p>The story follows a Traveller who is separated from their twin in a world called Teyvat. This traveller is the player's main character and is involved in the affairs of the various nations in Teyvat, in search for their lost twin sibling.</p>

<center><h2>Gacha System</h2></center>
<p>This game mainly employs a gacha system for characters and weapons, and the banners for these characters and weapons change about every three weeks to keep players enticed. There are some complicated counting systems within this gacha system, and every 90 wishes you make will guarantee a 5-star character!</p>
<p>Check out my own 10-wish, and I was really lucky to pull two 5-stars in such a small time period! I usually have to make about 70-80+ pulls to receive such a limited character.</p>
