  <h2><center>Raiden National Team</center></h2>
  <p>This team is called the Raiden National Team because it consists of a character named the Raiden Shogun (Electro), and she is supported by 3 common free-to-play(F2P) characters (2 fire, and 1 water). This makes it easy for players like myself to create a great team combo without having to spend money. They create a lot of interesting elemental reactions as the team is made up of various elemental skills. Check out my combat video!</p>

  <h2><center>Geo Team</center></h2>
  <p>This team is called the Geo Team, as it is comprised of multiple Geo members! As you can see below, three out of four members of the team possess Geo skills. The final slot is my fire-skilled healer, who does a great job at healing the team when needed! I enjoy the playstyle of this team very much as I have a shielder and a healer.
